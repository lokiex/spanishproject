Like many Indian languages, all Spanish nouns have a gender. This affects the articles and adjectives used with the nouns as they need to slightly change to adapt to the gender. In Spanish the use of articles (el - masculine and la - feminine) is extensive. In order to remember the gender of nouns in Spanish, It would be a good practice to learn the words for 'the' and 'a' which go before the noun and change with the gender, as explainen above.";
