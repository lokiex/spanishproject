<div class ="col-7">The position of the tongue while pronouncing c and z is almost the same. The English Z sound as in buzz does not exist in Spanish. For pronouning c and z correcting try saying the English word Myth and once you reach "th" freeze don&rsquo;t move. Now from that position (i.e. your tongue touching the back of your 3 upper front teeth, the central incisors) try saying the english word "say" it will come out as the sound produced by pronouncing seh in English. You will use this sound for seh (c) and sehta(z). Example Barcelona (Barsehlona) and Zoo (soh), you will use the 'myth' tongue position explained above and say soo )</div>

<div class ="col-7">When G is followed by ue - the u&nbsp; becomes silent and you prounounce it as&nbsp; the normally English g but skipping the u as if e is the next word and u does not exist. This rule also applies to Q. You will pronounce the q as it is but skip the u and jump to e</div>

<br>
<div class ="col-7">LL is pronounced as the combined sound of the English j and the English y. Many Spanish speaking people would pronounce it with very little stress on j sound almost as if they are more on the y sound. Yet there are other Spanish speaking countries where there is more stress on the J sound. But the sound produced as per my 3st explaination in my opinion is of a more common occurence.</div>

<div class ="col-7">X* - The X sound is similar to the English X sound when it comes in the middle of vowels or at the end. If X is the first letter of the word then it is pronounced similar to the S sound in English or Spanish. In medieval Spain the X sound was similar to the modern spanish J sound and hence M&eacute;xico was pronounced as M&eacute;jico and is still written in both the ways but pronounced as M&eacute;jico. Same is the case with Texas.</div>
<br>
<div class ="col-7">Y* - is still called e griyega (I griega) but the RAE has now changed it to yeh. Y is pronounced as the combined sound of the English j and the English y. Many Spanish speaking people would pronounce it with very little stress on the y sound almost as if they are more on the j sound. There are other Spanish speaking countries where there is even more stress on the j sound almost making it sound as a sh sound eg. Argentina. But the sound produced as per my 1st explaination in my opinion is of a more common occurence.<br /> &nbsp;Y when it comes on its own as a single letter in a word such as 'y' (meaning 'and') or at the end of a word it is pronounced as the English alphabet 'e' or the spanish sound for I.</div>
<br>
<div class ="col-7">&eacute; &aacute; &iacute; - The tilde (accent mark on the vowels e a i o are to put a stress on these vowels while pronouncing those words which have these accents on their vowels. Eg. Tel&eacute;fono (telay-fono), M&aacute;laga (Ma-laga) etc. </div>
