<p>A noun is a word used for naming a living being, thing or idea, for example,girl,table,peace,Rahul. Like many Indian languages, all Spanish nouns have a gender. This affects the articles and adjectives used with the nouns as they need to slightly change to adapt to the gender. In Spanish the use of articles (el - masculine and la - feminine) is extensive. In order to remember the gender of nouns in Spanish, It would be a good practice to learn the words for 'the' and 'a' which go before the noun and change with the gender, as explained above.


        
the in Spanish masculine is el (plural is los)
the in Spanish feminine is la (plural is las)
a in Spanish masculine is un (plural is unos)
a in Spanish feminine is una</p>
